# lists

This repository is an addition to my collection of small projects I am doing to learn Python.
I am learning this from the YouTube videos generously provided by freecodecamp.org and their
*Learn Python* playlist. 

Each `.py` file is a small exercise in various functions relative to the **list** data structure in Python.
Below are the descriptions of what I am doing in each one.

## Extending and Appending Lists

In this file, I...
- Created two different lists
- Used the `.extend()` function to add the lists to the end of each other
- Used a for-loop to generate a list with user-provided input

### Issue Noted

I noticed that the `.extend()` function is not working and am currently debugging this.

## Popping, Inserting, and Removing (from) Lists

In this file, I...
- Created a list of words
- Used the `.pop()` function to remove the last item in the list
- Used the `.insert()` function to insert a user-provided item into the list at an indicated index
- Let a user remove an item from a list with the `.remove()` function
- Demonstrated the use of the `.clear()` function
